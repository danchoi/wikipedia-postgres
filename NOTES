I should store the character length of the page_text. Can use that as a
proxy for the importance of the article.

Good query for content in science fiction category;

[[Category:parent_category_name]] onto the page that you would like to
make into a subcategory. This may seem counterintuitive, because you
edit the subcategory page rather than the parent category page.

Let's say that you wanted to make the category called Roses into a
subcategory of the category called Flowers.

Step 1 - Go to the page called [[Category:Roses]], and click edit this
page.  Step 2 - Place the text [[Category:Flowers]] within the body of
the [[Category:Roses]] article, and save. 

Finished! Roses is now a subcategory of Flowers, and 

[[Category:Roses]] will be visible on [[Category:Flowers]]. 

When writing the description for a category try to give it at least two
parent categories. For example, Category:British writers should be in
both Category:Writers by nationality and Category:British people. Some
categories do have only one parent category, but unless the parent
category has many potential articles under it, or many potential
subdivisions, if you can't think of a second parent category, it might
be a better idea to fold your smaller category into the parent.
